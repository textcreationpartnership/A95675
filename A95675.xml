            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115913:3"/> Hereſies, and dangerous Schiſms did much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; the Patrons of them proudly inſulting, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly acting for a Toleration of them, we rejoyced much in it, and bleſſed God for their holy boldneſs, and religious Zeal in this common Cauſe; and ſince di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Provinces have publiſhed their pious Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to the Truth, and their abhorrency of the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Errors; leſt we the Miniſters of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> ſhould lie under the imputation of betraying the common Faith, through our ſilence and neglect of concurrence with our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, having the ſame engagements lying upon us, as upon them; we being Miniſters of the Goſpel, having lifted up our hand to the moſt high God; having hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled our ſouls in that Solemn day appointed by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament, tendering the wellfare of our peoples ſouls: And laſtly, leſt that the diligence of the Adverſaries of the Truth, in promoting their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Doctrines both by their tongues and pens ſhould condemn our negligence. We therefore, whoſe names are hereunto ſubſcribed, do declare and teſtifie to all the Churches of Chriſt, to all our Brethren in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and to all that unfainedly love the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the ſound and elaborate Confeſſion of Faith, which the Aſſembly of Divines (convened by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament,) have preſented to the Honorable Houſes, is ſo conſonant to the Truth contained in the Scriptures, that we do give our full Conſent unto the whole, and to each part thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That we do from our very ſouls abhor, all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115913:3"/> the Errors, which (to the provoking of God to wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Kingdom, to the great ſhame of this Church, once famous for the maintenance of the Truth, and to the grief of all the godly) are lately ſprung up grown high, and ſpread far amongſt us, as <hi>Antiſcripturiſm, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſm, Anabaptiſm, Arminianiſm, Antinominianiſm, Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aeriſm, Eraſtianiſm,</hi> and whatſoever is contrary to ſound Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That an Univerſal Toleration ſo much pleaded for, and earneſtly deſired by the Sectaries is moſt ſinful, deſtructive, both to truth and godlineſs, and in its own nature the mother of all confuſion, both in Church and State; wherefore we cannot but bleſs God, that he hath ſtirred up the Honorable Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to publiſh an Ordinance for the puniſhing of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and groſs <hi>Errors;</hi> praying, That all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in their ſeveral places would be faithful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the execution of the ſaid Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe there cannot be a better damm to prevent the overflowing of all <hi>Blaſphemies, Hereſies, Errors, Schiſms,</hi> and <hi>Prophaneſs,</hi> then ſuch a form of Church-Government which is agreeable to the Word of God. We declare, that we are ſo fully convinced that that form of Church-Government tendred by the Aſſembly to the Honorable Houſes of Parliament, for their civil ſanction is ſo agreeable to the Word of God, that we can and ſhall readily ſubject our ſelves unto it, when it ſhall pleaſe God to ſtir up the hearts of thoſe in whoſe power it is to authorize the ſame. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſome who are of eminent worth, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſſenting from us in this particular; we heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115913:4"/> that there may be a ſweet Accommodation between us and them, which we conceive would be feaſible, did they abate of their love to their yet unproved opinion: and had they an higher eſteem of peace and unity; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince they cannot be ignorant, how God hath blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Congregational way, with <hi>Sects, Schiſms, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;</hi> and <hi>Subſeparations,</hi> to their ſhame, our grief, and the woful diſturbance of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, and Laſtly, Sithence God hath viſited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Nations with exemplary Judgments for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-breaking, which we alſo in this Kingdom may juſtly fear, becauſe of our guiltineſs in that reſpect; the Solemn League and Covenant being not only violated by moſt, but decryed by ſome, and unworthily compared to an Almanack out of date; by which means ſome in <hi>Scotland</hi> take advantage to pretend a juſt ground of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging War againſt us, (which God in his mercy avert;) We therefore declare, that it is as obligatory upon us now, as at the firſt taking of the ſame, and are reſolved through Gods gracious aſſiſtance to endeavour a ſincere obſervance of it in all particulars all the days of our lives; we knowing that it is not in the power of any to abſolve us from it, or to impoſe any other ſenſe then what is in the plain and literal expreſſion of it. And we hope God will enable us to be as ready to witneſs a good Confeſſion of the Truth, being thereunto called, with our deareſt blood, as now to profeſs it by the ſigning of this with our hands.</p>
